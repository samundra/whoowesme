_Note:_ This project is for educational purpose only. Please do not use it for production.

Suppose, I gave you 100 THB, since I am generous I forget to ask. This
app will force me to ask for that borrowed money to my friend.

Planned features are:

- Keep track of borrowed money
- Show total money borrowed
- Show borrowed to whom
- When was it borrowed

### Docker Setup for Development

**Domains:**

- Frontend: http://whoowesme.local
- API: http://api.whoowesme.local

Open `/etc/hosts` and enter `127.0.0.1 whoowesme.local api.whoowesme.local`

After that, run below docker commands from project root directory

Create external network that will be used for networking.

```
# Create external network
$ docker network create web

# Create external volume
$ docker volume create who-data

# Run docker containers
$ docker-compose up -d
```

For frontend, wait for this output:

```
whoowesme-frontend |
whoowesme-frontend | You can now view whooweme in the browser.
whoowesme-frontend |
whoowesme-frontend |   Local:            http://localhost:8000
whoowesme-frontend |   On Your Network:  http://172.18.0.3:8000
whoowesme-frontend |
whoowesme-frontend | Note that the development build is not optimized.
whoowesme-frontend | To create a production build, use npm run build.
whoowesme-frontend |
```

For API, wait for this output:

```

Check again to make sure that all containers are running fine without errors:

```
$ docker ps
